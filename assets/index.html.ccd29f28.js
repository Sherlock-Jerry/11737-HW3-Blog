It's not confined to a specific task but can accomplish a variety of them, including translating languages, summarizing text, answering questions, and more. You might wonder how a single model can perform such diverse tasks. This is achieved by adding task-specific prefixes to the input sequence and pre-training the model to produce prefix-specific outputs.The T5 model undergoes both unsupervised and supervised pre-training. In the unsupervised setting, spans are masked with a special token, and the model predicts the masked sequence. In the supervised setting, the input consists of the task name followed by the required input text, and the expected target text is provided as the corresponding output.
